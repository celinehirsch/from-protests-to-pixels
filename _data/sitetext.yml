    body: |
      The last century witnessed key social and political events that transformed many facets of human society, ranging from World War I, to Black History, to Digital Revolution. Cinema, being a way to depict real-life, can reflect all those core societal events and movements.
      Our project aims to assess the most influential events and movements of the past century by analyzing their societal impact through the film industry. Recognizing cinema as a reflection of society, we will dig into various aspects of the movie industry related to each event. Six different factors, such as the quantity of films produced and their average ratings, will be considered as indicators of impact. The combined results of these assessments will ultimately guide us in determining the event that had the most significant impact on the world.
