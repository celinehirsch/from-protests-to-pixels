The digital revolution, emerging in the latter half of the 20th century, represents a shift from the mechanical and analog electronics established during the 19th century through the industrial revolution to the era of digital electronics.Key discoveries, including integrated circuit chips, MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors), and digital logic, played a crucial role in steering this remarkable technological growth. However, the transformative impact extended beyond hardware innovations. The invention and democratization of the World Wide Web in 1989 marked a paradigm change, revolutionizing the way individuals lived and interacted. This development facilitated rapid and extensive information sharing across the globe, leading to a decade where the majority of citizens in modern societies owned computers and used mobile phones. The 2000s witnessed further technological evolution, marked by the rise of social media, sophisticated video games, and the common use of smartphones, shaping contemporary day-to-day life. Today, the persistent importance of digital technologies is underscored by the continuous progress, significant investments and keen interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science.The remarkable breakthroughs in these domains highlight their potential and the innovation they promise for our future.\
