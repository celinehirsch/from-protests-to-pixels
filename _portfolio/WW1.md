World War I, also called the Great War, was a global conflict that occurred between 1914 and 1918. The world's greatest powers were involved and divided into two opposing alliances, the Allies and the Central Powers. France, Russia, and the United Kingdom led the Allies while Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire led the Central Powers. Tensions among the different European nations were already present before the outbreak of the war, which was triggered by the assassination of Archduke of Austria-Hungary Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist organization. Due to the complex alliance systems present, this war quickly escalated to a World War. Due to new military technologies such as tanks, machine guns, and chemical weapons, a new form of war was introduced leading to extreme levels of destruction. The Western Front was characterized by trench warfare, which quickly became a symbol for the hopelessness of the conflict, fighting back and forth over a few kilometers. This war resulted in significant geopolitical changes that had a profound impact on the course of history, laying the groundwork for World War II and the rest of the 20th century.
