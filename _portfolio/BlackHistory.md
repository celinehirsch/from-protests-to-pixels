Throughout history, black communities have endured exploitation and discrimination at the hands of European societies, often serving as a source of enrichment and growth for others. However, the last century has been marked by significant events that paved the way for the emancipation and rights equality of black people in modern societies. The end of slavery through human trade with the Brussels Conference Act in 1890 allowed black people to gain limited independence and essential human rights. Later on, civil rights movements of the 1960s inspired people to challenge racial injustice. The struggle against apartheid in South Africa reached its zenith recently with Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990, culminating in his election as president in 1994. In the United States, the fight against racial discrimination led by Martin Luther King persisted beyond the 1960s, with the end of de jure segregation occurring in the 1970s. Hence, the legacy of racial discrimination remains a contemporary societal challenge, deeply ingrained in minds worldwide. Recent movements like Black Lives Matter underscore the ongoing need to still address systemic racism and promote inclusivity occurring nowadays.
