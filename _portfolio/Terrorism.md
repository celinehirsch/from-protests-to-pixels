The unprecedented events of September 11, 2001, witnessed the hijacking of four passenger planes by the extremist group al-Qaeda. Two of them crashed into the iconic Twin Towers in New York City, leading to their collapse. Simultaneously, another plane struck the Pentagon in Washington D.C., causing extensive damage. The impact of the attacks, which resulted in the loss of nearly 3,000 lives, deeply startled the international community and served as a stark reminder to modern societies about the ever-present threat of terrorism.Terrorism designates the use of extreme ideologies, often rooted in political or religious beliefs, to justify acts of violence aimed at instigating fear, intimidation and destruction. The 21st century surge in terrorism presented a challenge to conventional security systems, prompting the need for new strategies that integrate military forces, intelligence, international collaboration, and advanced technologies to effectively counter radical threats. Since 09.11, other striking terrorist attacks have taken place in the beginning of the 21st century such as the Madrid Train Bombings in 2004, the Paris Attacks in 2015 or the Brussels Bombings in 2016. These notable incidents highlight the persistent challenge faced by societies in protecting their citizens against extremist acts.
