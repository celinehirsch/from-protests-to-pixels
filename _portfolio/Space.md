The Space Race describes an international competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve success in space exploration and technology. This was during the Cold War, being one of the non-military stages where the war took place, each country trying to show their superiority and therefore the superiority of their ideology (capitalism vs communism). 
The start of the Space Race is marked by the launching of the first artificial satellite “Sputnik 1” by the USSR in 1957. In 1969 the US NASA performed the Apollo 11 mission with which they landed the first human being on the moon, Neil Armstrong. 
The end of the Space Race was marked with increased cooperation between the two powers in terms of space exploration, exemplified by the “Apollo-Soyuz” mission in 1975.
