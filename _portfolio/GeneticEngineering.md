Genetic engineering involves altering an organism's genes to achieve specific traits or outcomes. While this idea may seem contemporary, humans have long embraced this concept through practices like selective breeding and artificial selection of organisms. Nevertheless, the substantial technological advancements of the 20th century have elevated genetic engineering to a new level, employing more sophisticated scientific methods. The generation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) traces back to 1973 when the first genetically modified bacteria emerged, followed by the creation of the initial genetically modified animal a year later. These breakthroughs have ushered in novel possibilities across natural sciences and diverse fields, particularly in agriculture and medicine. For the latter, genetic engineering has paved the way for advancements such as gene therapies, the development of animal model organisms enhancing our comprehension of human diseases, and the innovation of new treatment methods. However, genetic engineering stands at the center of many controversies, particularly in relation to the food industry and the commercialization of genetically modified crops. While these GMOs have enhanced agricultural practices, optimizing harvest yields and allowing farmers to boost their income, concerns about the safety of genetically modified foods persist.
