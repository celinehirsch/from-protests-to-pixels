World War II was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The war began with Germany's invasion of Poland which compelled France and Great Britain to declare war on Germany. This further escalated, leading to the so-called Axis powers (Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan and Fascist Italy) to seek land expansion. 
The war raged on many different continents including Europe, Asia and Africa and was accompanied by the horrors of the Holocaust. The United States joined the war in 1941 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japan and made an unexpected alliance with the communist Soviet Union. 
The war ended in 1945 with Germany and Japan surrendering unconditionally. With the end of the war the danger of nuclear weapons was displayed to the world, setting the stage for the Cold War in the years to come.
