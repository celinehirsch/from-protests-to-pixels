In July 1945 the United States successfully tested the world’s first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. Later that year the US dropped an atomic bomb named “Little Boy” on Hiroshima and another one named “Fat Man” on Nagasaki leading to the end of the Second World War through Japan's unconditional surrender. The use of the atomic bomb was highly controversial, leading to ethical and moral questions to be raised about the devastation and long-term effects these types of bombs cause. This bombing also marks the beginning of the Cold War which was characterized by a race for nuclear arms between the Western and the Eastern block with opposing ideologies.
