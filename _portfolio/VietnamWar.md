The Vietnam War lasted between 1955 and 1975 and consisted of the communist government of North Vietnam which was backed by the Soviet Union fighting the non-communist government of South Vietnam which was backed by the United States. It was one of the indirect battles that the US and the USSR fought during the Cold War to prove the superiority of their respective ideologies and spread it. 
The war was characterized by guerilla warfare, extensive use of chemical agents (such as Agent Orange), heavy bombing and increased involvement of foreign powers. It evoked high controversy around the world, specifically also in the US due to its involvement, fuelling the hippie anti-war movement. 
With the Paris Peace Accords being signed in 1973, the US started to gradually withdraw its forces. The war officially ended in 1975 with the fall of the capital of South Vietnam, establishing Vietnam as a unified communist country.
