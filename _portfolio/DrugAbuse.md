Drug abuse entails the excessive, hazardous and harmful consumption of both legal and illegal substances, potentially leading to addictions’ risks or fatal outcomes. Unrestrained use of substances like opioids, cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), methamphetamine, cannabis, or benzodiazepines can result in hallucinations, depression, anxiety, and both physical and psychological dependence, along with other acute intoxicating effects. The lingering presence of these symptoms, even after ceasing use, can contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders in many cases. From the mid-20th century, governments swiftly recognized the peril associated with such behaviors and endeavored to manage the commercialization and oversee the use of drugs through the implementation of drug control laws. These efforts were strengthened as drug use escalated among the youth and the counterculture movement gained popularity in the 1960s. Unfortunately, these measures inadvertently encouraged criminal organizations like cartels mainly from Latin or South to illicitly export their products, as the trade proved highly lucrative, particularly since many substances were chemically derived from plants originally cultivated in those regions. Thus, a persistent global war on drugs continues as nations strive to safeguard people’s health.
