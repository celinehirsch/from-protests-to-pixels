Sexually transmitted diseases, abbreviated as STDs, are infections predominantly transmitted through sexual activity, especially vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Resulting from bacteria, viruses, or parasites, they have the potential to affect various parts of the body but in many cases can be asymptomatic. Common STDs include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea and herpes. Prior to the 20th century, most of these STDs were not curable, yet treatments for alleviating the patients from severe or disabling symptoms were existing. Antibioticsâ€™ advent in the 1960s coupled with impactful health campaigns contributed to decrease the incidence of STDs, mitigating their severe impact on populations. During the 1980s, the public became aware of the existence of AIDS, caused by the HIV virus, following its initial clinical identification in the US. As modern medicine had not yet discovered a cure and with AIDS involving a prolonged asymptomatic period followed by a potentially deadly symptomatic phase, people held significant concerns and fears about contracting the infection. AIDS being initially discovered in individuals from the LGBTQIA+ community or those facing substance abuse contributed to a profound societal and cultural stigma. This led to the rejection and avoidance of HIV-positive people, while exacerbating latent homophobia or reinforcing stigmas related to intravenous drug use around the world.
